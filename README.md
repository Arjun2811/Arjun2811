## 🚀 About Me
I’m a motivated Computer Science graduate student (3.66 GPA) with nearly 2 years of professional software development and automation experience specializing in Java. Currently a Frontend Engineering Intern at Abe Scott Enterprises, I’ve built mission-critical UI modules and championed accessibility standards. Previously, I accelerated Verizon’s core modules at Cognizant and co-founded a data-driven e-commerce startup serving 4,000+ customers.

I love crafting full-stack solutions, diving deep on data-driven features, and continuously learning new technologies.
**💡 Solved 500+ data structures & algorithms problems** across LeetCode, Codeforces, and HackerRank—sharpening problem-solving and performance under time constraints.
